    <h1 id="infoboxtitle">IRC Info</h1>
    <p>IRC is Internet Relay Chat.<br>
       All messages in IRC are bridged to Discord and the Minecraft Server<br>
       Dakto INC has an IRC Channel for an easier way to discuss:</p>
       <ul>
       	 <li>Channel: #daktoinc</li>
       	 <li>Network: irc.esper.net</li>

    <h1 id="infoboxtitle">How to tell where a message is from Minecraft or IRC?</h1>
    <p>Minecraft chat will look like "<dakbot> %name% Â» example" while IRC will look like "[Discord] IRC: <%username%> example". IRC chat is only connected to Discord and Discord is connected to Minecraft so IRC chat shows on Minecraft via Discord. You can see where a message is from Minecraft chat on IRC by seeing if its from a bot called "dakbot" which is the bridge for Minecraft and IRC.</p>  
    
    <h1 id="infoboxtitle">What IRC Client would you recommend?</h1>
    <p>I (Dakto) mainly use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io">HexChat Client</a> as its free and easy to use for Linux. If you do not want to download an IRC client then you should use <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>. For Windows users, a good IRC client you could use is <a href="https://adiirc.com">AdiIRC</a>, this client has loads of fun features that you can mess around with. Also supports scripting, themes, translations. The reason HexChat is a great IRC client is because it is highly scriptable with Lua, Python and Perl. Translated in multiple languages, fully open source and actively developed and an easy to use, customizable interface.</p>
