        <p><strong>From OnlyQwQ - 5 July 2025</strong> Hi all, recently we have installed a plugin that could provide the 1.20 smithing table ui for older minecraft client so that older minecraft client can use smithing table from now on.

        <p><strong>From dakto - 5 July 2025</strong> If you have noticed that your signs have no text on them, this is because there has been a sign data corruption that happened with switching from 1.21.6 to 1.21.4. We hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience.</p>
        <p><strong>From OnlyQwQ - 5 July 2025 -</strong> Hi all, recently we have upgraded the SMP to 1.21.6 but right now we are changing version again. This time however we are changing version to 1.21.4. This change comes with a few changes:

            <li>(Chestshop -> QuickShop-Hikari)</li>
            <li>Sign breakage</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>From dakto - 4 July 2025 -</strong> We aren't the only one who had this issue before.</p>

           </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>From dakto - 2 July 2025 -</strong> Hi all, recently we have noticed that people would like an update of the SMP since 1.12.2 is 8 years old now and such we have updated the SMP to Spigot 1.16.5 (running on JDK 21 with @OnlyQwQ custom build) which comes with a few changes.

        <p><strong>From wdxvvy - 26 June 2025 - Hello everyone.</strong> After observing activity levels over the last few weeks, I have noticed that some members of the Admin and Mod team are not active or involved in the server or community. While I appreciate everyone who has contributed in the past, staff roles are for people who are consistently active and helping out. Therefore, I will be making some changes to the team and removing the staff roles of those who are not active or not fulfilling their responsibilities. It's nothing personal - it's about keeping the team active and making room for people who want to participate and support the growth of the server. If you have been demoted and you think a mistake has been made, or you would like to return with a more active role, feel free to contact me directly. Thank you for your understanding, -wdxvvy</p>
